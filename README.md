## Design

This project is designed with a Firebase Firestore database storing the details of each GitHub project. This Firestore database is updated from a Python script utilizing the GitHub API. This pattern allows the portfolio content to stay up to date without having to continually make updates to this repository. It also ensures the content on this portfolio page stays aligned with the content found in each GitHub project.

## Bugs & Improvements

- Add cursor tracker and sprite sheet logic to animate the avatar looking at cursor.
